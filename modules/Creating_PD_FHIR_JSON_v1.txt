Creating_PD_FHIR_JSON_v1
This document explain how I went about creating PD_FHIR_JSON_v1.
Note: PD_FHIR_JSON_v1 is more of a research on how to capture the idea of an immunization receipt in FHIR.
PD_FHIR_JSON_v1 file itself just serves as a FHIR JSON template.
This file (Creating_PD_FHIR_JSON_v1) explains how PD_FHIR_JSON_v1 is structured.    

Information on FHIR:

FHIR DSTU 2 - http://www.hl7.org/FHIR/2015May/index.html

Note this was FHIR v0.5.0 which is DSTU 2 (April 2, 2015) See: http://www.hl7.org/FHIR/directory.html

The PD_FHIR_JSON_v1 was created using the resources from this location. http://www.hl7.org/FHIR/2015May/resourcelist.html#tabs-2

Here is a simple description of the JSON document and FHIR resources being used:

The first resource is a composition what it says is:
This is a document of type compositions its subject is #patient1 and the document was authored by #practitioner1 and #device1.

Now the rest or the resources contains additional information that is needed to be communicated in a immunization receipt

- The practitioner resource describes a practitioner/provider in this case this provider is given the reference practioner1.

- patient resource describes the patient

- immunization resource describes the immunization

- I use a ConsentDirective (contract) to capture the consent givers permission to share the information.

- The relatedperson is a person who is related to the patient (in this case they are the consent giver)

- organization (with id = organization1) is the organization that the provider belongs to
- organization (with id = organization2) is the organization of the vaccine manufacturer

-location is used to capture the service delivery location (the place where provider immunized the patient)

-device is used to capture the information for the device - in this case we can just use it to save the application name. 



Some more details:

I choose to use a Compositions after reading its definition on FHIR website:

The Composition resource – defines a set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a single logical document that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to who is making the statement. The composition resource provides the basic structure of a FHIR document. The full content of the document is expressed using a bundle. Compositions will often reference Lists as the focus of particular sections.

To reference one resource to another I am using internal references but I am not sure if I am using them correctly implementation wise.
